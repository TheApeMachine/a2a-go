# Bug Fixes Summary

## Bug 1: Directory Creation Race Condition and Resource Leak
**Location:** `cmd/root.go`, lines 91-132  
**Type:** Logic Error & Resource Leak  
**Severity:** Medium

### Problem Description
The `writeConfig` function had several issues:
1. **Race Condition**: Directory creation was only attempted for the first file (idx == 0), but the check was flawed
2. **Resource Leak**: File handles weren't being closed properly on error paths
3. **Poor Error Handling**: Used `os.Mkdir` instead of `os.MkdirAll`, which could fail if parent directories didn't exist

### Root Cause
The code assumed that only one file would be processed and had improper error handling for file operations.

### Fix Applied
- Moved directory creation outside the loop using `os.MkdirAll`
- Added proper file handle cleanup on error paths
- Improved error handling and logging
- Simplified logic by removing unnecessary index-based conditions

### Impact
- Eliminated race condition
- Prevented resource leaks
- Made the code more robust and maintainable

## Bug 2: Infinite Loop Risk in Bucket Creation
**Location:** `cmd/agent.go`, lines 58-84  
**Type:** Logic Error  
**Severity:** High

### Problem Description
The bucket creation loop had critical flaws:
1. **Infinite Loop Risk**: Used `try != 10` condition which could loop forever if bucket creation consistently failed
2. **Poor Retry Logic**: Break statements were placed incorrectly, causing premature exits
3. **No Final Error Handling**: Failed silently after all retries were exhausted

### Root Cause
The loop condition `try != 10` combined with improper increment timing and break statements created unpredictable behavior.

### Fix Applied
- Changed to proper for loop with `try < maxRetries` condition
- Fixed retry logic to properly handle both bucket existence checks and creation failures
- Added proper error handling that returns an error after all retries are exhausted
- Improved logging with attempt numbers for better debugging
- Added exponential backoff with better timing

### Impact
- Eliminated infinite loop risk
- Improved error handling and debugging
- Made the application more resilient to MinIO connectivity issues

## Bug 3: Memory Leak in Session Store
**Location:** `pkg/stores/session_store.go`  
**Type:** Memory Leak  
**Severity:** High

### Problem Description
The in-memory session store had no mechanism to clean up old sessions:
1. **Memory Leak**: Sessions accumulated indefinitely in memory
2. **No Expiration**: Sessions never expired, leading to stale data
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Long-running applications would eventually run out of memory

### Root Cause
The session store was designed as a simple map with no lifecycle management for stored data.

### Fix Applied
- Added session expiration functionality with configurable timeout (default 24 hours)
- Implemented automatic cleanup through a background goroutine
- Added expiration checks on session retrieval
- Extended the interface to include a `Cleanup()` method for manual cleanup
- Wrapped session data with expiration timestamps

### Impact
- Eliminated memory leaks
- Improved application stability for long-running deployments
- Added proper session lifecycle management
- Made the session store production-ready

## Summary of Improvements

### Security Improvements
- **Session Security**: Added proper session expiration to prevent stale session attacks
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup prevents resource exhaustion attacks

### Performance Improvements
- **Memory Usage**: Automatic cleanup reduces memory footprint
- **Error Recovery**: Better retry logic reduces unnecessary operations

### Reliability Improvements
- **Robustness**: Eliminated infinite loops and race conditions
- **Error Handling**: Proper error propagation and logging
- **Cleanup**: Automatic resource management

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more understandable logic
- **Debugging**: Better logging and error messages
- **Testability**: More predictable behavior makes testing easier

All fixes maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving the application's robustness, security, and performance characteristics.
