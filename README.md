# ðŸŒˆ A2Aâ€‘Go

> _"Combine A2A and MCP to create advanced, distributed agentic systems!"_

A2A-Go is a framework for building scalable, distributed agentic AI systems. It promotes a microservice architecture where agents and tools operate as independent services, deployable locally or across a network. The framework implements the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol and utilizes the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized tool interaction and data exchange.

![A2Aâ€‘Go](a2a-go.png)

**a2aâ€‘go** is a reference Go implementation of the [**Agentâ€‘toâ€‘Agent (A2A)**
protocol](https://google.github.io/A2A/#/) by Google, including the proposed
interoperability with the [**Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Use the `Makefile` to run a full containerized distributed system, demonstrating A2A and MCP interoperability.

```bash
make server
make client
```

The `ui` agent is mapped to port `3212`. If you run the TUI outside the Docker
network, update `agent.ui.url` in `~/.a2a-go/config.yml` to point to
`http://localhost:3212`.
